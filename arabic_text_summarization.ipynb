              "'يكون سعر الفاكهة والخضراوات في موسم إنباتها أقل من غيره من المواسم، وستلجأ محلات الخضروات إلى عرض الفاكهة بأسعار مناسبة في موسمها بسبب توفر المنتجات وزيادة الطلب عليها خلال تلك الفترات. لا يقتصر الأمر على السعر الأقل، بل سيكون طعامك من الخضراوات والفاكهة أشهى وألذ عند تناوله في موسمه.   في فصل الخريف: التفاح والتين والبنجر والكمثرى والقرنبيط والكرنب واليقطين في فصل الشتاء: (الخضراوات) الملفوف والفاصوليا والبازلاء والبصل (الفواكه)  البطاطا الحلوة والأفوكادو والبرتقال والتفاح والموز واليوسفى والرمان والعنب. في فصل الربيع: السبانخ والجزر والكوسة والبصل الأخضر  والطماطم والخضراوات الورقية والفراولة والمشمش. في فصل الصيف: الصيف هو فصل البطيخ، وكذلك الأمر بالنسبة للذرة والتوت. سوف تلاحظ توفر هذه الخضراوات والفواكهة المهمة على مدار العام كله بشكل أو آخر، ولكنها تكون بأرخص أسعارها في فصل الصيف، وهو ما يمكنك من شراء كميات كبيرة منها وتخزينها أو تجميدها في المجمد (الفريزر). الأفضل لصحتك البدنية والمالية على حد سواء هو تناول الفواكه والخضراوات والأطعمة الطازجة عامة، ولكن في بعض الحالات قد يكون من الأرخص بالنسبة لك الاعتماد على الطعام المعبأ. سوف تحصل منه على نفس الفوائد الغذائية بشرط التأكد من أنه غير مضاف إليه أي ملح أو سكر أو مواد مصنعة.  اتبع هذه النصيحة مع الفواكه والخضراوات وكذلك مع مصادر البروتينات؛ قد يكون سعر الفراخ المجمدة مثلا أرخص من الطازجة، وبالمثل في حالة عبوات التونة والسالمون مقارنة بشراء السمك من كلا النوعين طازجا. تحرص العديد من محلات الأطعمة الغذائية باختلاف أنواعها على تقديم عروض خاصة لعملائها بوتيرة أسبوعية، وهو ما يمكنك الاطلاع عليه عبر مطبوعات الإعلانات وصفحاتهم الرسمية عبر وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي. اغتنم أوقات العروض على واحدة من الأطعمة وجهز نفسك واهجم على المحل لاقتناء أكبر كمية ممكنة على أمل تخزينها في منزلك بشكل أو آخر؛ إنها صفقة لا تعوض. يمكنك تخزين أغلبية أنواع اللحوم على سبيل المثال، لذا بمجرد رؤيتك لهذا العرض الخاص على صدور الدجاج في واحدة من المحلات الكبرى، أسرع فورا واشتر كمية مناسبة يمكنك تخزين الزائد منها عن حاجتك لوقت لاحق. إنها مهارة تتقنها كل ربات البيوت وإلا لما نجحت جداتنا وأمهاتنا في تربية عدد ضخم من الأبناء بقدر ضئيل من المرتبات، وبنسبة كبيرة أنك تحرصين بدورك على شراء أرخص العلامات التجارية المقبولة وقد سبق لك إجراء مثل هذه المقارنة، لكن ما نود الإشارة إليه هو عدم الارتكان دائما لنفس خيار الشراء بوصفه الأرخص ثمنا، لأنه ربما كان كذلك منذ شهور، بينما قد توفر في السوق الآن خيار بديل بسعر أفضل. عملية المقارنة بين الأسعار مهمة ضرورية قبل كل عملية شراء قدر الإمكان، لذا لا تفقدي يقظتك أبدا. عادة ما يتاح كذلك عروض مميزة على شراء الكميات الكبيرة أو خصما على منتج معين لفترة محدودة، لذا من خلال عملية البحث والمقارنة المستمرة يمكنك الذهاب إلى السوق وشراء كل ما يلزمك بأفضل سعر ممكن.    انقلي بصرك لأعلى وأسفل رفوف المحلات التجارية، فغالبا ما يتعمد البائعون وضع السلع الأغلى ثمنا في مستوى العين لكي يبادر المستهلكون دائما لاقتنائها وإغفال النظر عن غيرها من الخيارات رخيصة الثمن. ابحثي عن السلع والأطعمة المحلية والمصنعة باسم المتجر التجاري نفسه، والتي عادة ما تكون بسعر أقل مقارنة بالعلامات التجارية الكبرى. سوف تقف أمام البائع وتدفع رقما ضخما نظير شرائك للسلع بالجملة، ولكن بحسبة بسيطة ستكتشف أنك حصلت على الوحدة الواحدة من المنتج بثمن أرخص من الشراء بالقطعة. توجد متاجر خاصة بالبيع بالجملة كما يتوفر هذا الاختيار في كل المحلات العادية كذلك؛ عند شرائك لدستة من منتج معين، سيكون إجمالي السعر أرخص من شراء نفس عدد العبوات بشكل منفرد على أكثر من مرة.   يمكنك الشراء بالجملة من متاجر السلع المعبئة (السوبرماركت) ونفس الأمر بالنسبة لمحلات الفاكهة والخضراوات والسلع الغذائية الصحية (العضوية). يحرص البائعون على توفير سلع مثل: الحبوب والبقول والمكرونة (غير المعبئة) والمكسرات والدقيق والسكر وما شابه، للشراء بالجملة. حاول شراء السلع سابقة الذكر من المحلات المدعومة تبعا لوزارة التموين في بلدك، فقد تحصل منها على نفس السلع بنفس جودة العلامات التجارية الكبرى ولكن بسعر مخفض. ضع نصب عينيك حقيقة وجود فترة زمنية قصوى يمكنك خلالها استهلاك ما اشتريته من سلع بالجملة، فمهما كان من الممكن تخزينها أو تجميدها، ستجد نفسك أمام حقيقة أن ما اشتريته معرضا لانتهاء صلاحيته بعد عدة شهور. استوعب مناسبة تلك الكمية الكبيرة لمعدل استهلاكك أنت وأسرتك (ورغبتهم في أكلها أصلا) من الأطعمة ودون أن تنسى إدراج فترة صلاحية المنتج ضمن تلك المعادلة الحسابية الصعبة، فلا فائدة من شراء شيء رخيص ولكنه سيلقى على الأرض بلا فائدة عندما يصبح غير صالح للاستخدام. لا تترك قسيمة شراء تهرب من تحت يدك بمجرد وجود فرصة للحصول عليها، لكن على الجانب الآخر لا تشتر سوى السلع والمنتجات التي تعرف أنك بحاجة إلى استخدامها. لا فائدة من شراء منتج لا تشتريه في العادة -مهما كان رخيص الثمن- لأنك ستنفق أموالك على ما لا تحتاجه وما لن ترغب في استخدامه، وستضيع أموالك على الأرض بلا فائدة، وستدرك وقتها أنها كانت صفقة خاسرة.  يمكنك إيجاد قسائم الشراء عبر الإنترنت أو في الجرائد والمجلات، كما يمكنك الاستفادة حديثا من تطبيقات قسائم الشراء على الهواتف الذكية. قد تكون مؤهلا للاشتراك في واحدة من برامج دعم الغذاء لمحدودي الدخل في بلدك، وهي الجهات التي توفر الطعام بأسعار مدعومة للمحتاجين.   تختلف أنظمة دعم التموين والطعام من بلد لآخر، لذانص مائل ستحتاج لإجراء عملية بحث بسيطة لمعرفة إجراءات التسجيل في مثل هذه البرامج. قد تجد برامج مخصصة للعاطلين من الأفراد أو السيدات قليلات الدخل أو للأسر كبيرة العدد وما شابه. قد لا تتوفر لك في المتاجر التابعة لمثل برامج الدعم تلك كل ما تطمع وتشتهيه من سلع، ولكنك ستجد بها الحد الأدنى من احتياجاتك من الأطعمة الصحية والضروريات اللازمة من الطعام.   اذهب إلى المكتب المحلي المخصص للتقدم بطلب الحصول على الدعم أو يمكنك التقدم عبر المنصات والمواقع الإلكترونية في حال توفرها. تواصلي مع الجهات المسؤولة عن تقديم الدعم للعاطلين وللسيدات محدودات الدخل وما شابه في مدينتك لمعرفة كيفية التقدم للاشتراك في برامج الدعم المماثلة. تجد العديد من السلع الغذائية الأرخص سعرا في المتاجر التابعة مباشرة للمزارع المحلية، وإن كنت ستواجه صعوبة في الحصول على احتياجك من السلع نظرا لضغط الطلب وقلة المعروض من منتجات غالبا. إنها أطعمة طازجة ولم يضاف إليها تكاليف النقل وأرباح الكثير من الموزعين والبائعين، لذا ستقدر على الحصول عليها بسعر أرخص وجودة أفضل. استوعب فقط أنك لن تملك رفاهية تأجيل تناولها كونها لا تظل على حالتها فترات طويلة مقارنة بغيرها من السلع الغذائية المزروعة لتحمل مشقة النقل والفترات الزمنية الطويلة قبل التناول. الميزة الإيجابية أنك ستقدر على تناول أطعمة أفضل مذاقا وطزاجة.  قد تجد بعض المزارع المحلية المدرجة ضمن برامج الدعم الحكومي للطعام والتي توفر للمستحقين إمكانية شراء الفاكهة والخضراوات بسعر أقل.'"

لا يقتصر الأمر على السعر الأقل، بل سيكون طعامك من الخضراوات والفاكهة أشهى وألذ عند تناوله في موسمه في فصل الخريف التفاح والتين والبنجر والكمثرى والقرنبيط والكرنب واليقطين في فصل الشتاء الخضراوات الملفوف والفاصوليا والبازلاء والبصل الفواكه البطاطا الحلوة والأفوكادو والبرتقال والتفاح والموز واليوسفى والرمان والعنب في فصل الربيع السبانخ والجزر والكوسة والبصل الأخضر والطماطم والخضراوات الورقية والفراولة والمشمش في فصل الصيف الصيف هو فصل البطيخ، وكذلك الأمر بالنسبة للذرة والتوت سوف تلاحظ توفر هذه الخضراوات والفواكهة المهمة على مدار العام كله بشكل أو آخر، ولكنها تكون بأرخص أسعارها في فصل الصيف، وهو ما يمكنك من شراء كميات كبيرة منها وتخزينها أو تجميدها في المجمد الفريزر الأفضل لصحتك البدنية والمالية على حد سواء هو تناول الفواكه والخضراوات والأطعمة الطازجة عامة، ولكن في بعض الحالات قد يكون من الأرخص بالنسبة لك الاعتماد على الطعام المعبأ سوف تحصل منه على نفس الفوائد الغذائية بشرط التأكد من أنه غير مضاف إليه أي ملح أو سكر أو مواد مصنعة اتبع هذه النصيحة مع الفواكه والخضراوات وكذلك مع مصادر البروتينات؛ قد يكون سعر الفراخ المجمدة مثلا أرخص من الطازجة، وبالمثل في حالة عبوات التونة والسالمون مقارنة بشراء السمك من كلا النوعين طازجا تحرص العديد من محلات الأطعمة الغذائية باختلاف أنواعها على تقديم عروض خاصة لعملائها بوتيرة أسبوعية، وهو ما يمكنك الاطلاع عليه عبر مطبوعات الإعلانات وصفحاتهم الرسمية عبر وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي اغتنم أوقات العروض على واحدة من الأطعمة وجهز نفسك واهجم على المحل لاقتناء أكبر كمية ممكنة على أمل تخزينها في منزلك بشكل أو آخر؛ إنها صفقة لا تعوض يمكنك تخزين أغلبية أنواع اللحوم على سبيل المثال، لذا بمجرد رؤيتك لهذا العرض الخاص على صدور الدجاج في واحدة من المحلات الكبرى، أسرع فورا واشتر كمية مناسبة يمكنك تخزين الزائد منها عن حاجتك لوقت لاحق إنها مهارة تتقنها كل ربات البيوت وإلا لما نجحت جداتنا وأمهاتنا في تربية عدد ضخم من الأبناء بقدر ضئيل من المرتبات، وبنسبة كبيرة أنك تحرصين بدورك على شراء أرخص العلامات التجارية المقبولة وقد سبق لك إجراء مثل هذه المقارنة، لكن ما نود الإشارة إليه هو عدم الارتكان دائما لنفس خيار الشراء بوصفه الأرخص ثمنا، لأنه ربما كان كذلك منذ شهور، بينما قد توفر في السوق الآن خيار بديل بسعر أفضل عملية المقارنة بين الأسعار مهمة ضرورية قبل كل عملية شراء قدر الإمكان، لذا لا تفقدي يقظتك أبدا عادة ما يتاح كذلك عروض مميزة على شراء الكميات الكبيرة أو خصما على منتج معين لفترة محدودة، لذا من خلال عملية البحث والمقارنة المستمرة يمكنك الذهاب إلى السوق وشراء كل ما يلزمك بأفضل سعر ممكن انقلي بصرك لأعلى وأسفل رفوف المحلات التجارية، فغالبا ما يتعمد البائعون وضع السلع الأغلى ثمنا في مستوى العين لكي يبادر المستهلكون دائما لاقتنائها وإغفال النظر عن غيرها من الخيارات رخيصة الثمن ابحثي عن السلع والأطعمة المحلية والمصنعة باسم المتجر التجاري نفسه، والتي عادة ما تكون بسعر أقل مقارنة بالعلامات التجارية الكبرى سوف تقف أمام البائع وتدفع رقما ضخما نظير شرائك للسلع بالجملة، ولكن بحسبة بسيطة ستكتشف أنك حصلت على الوحدة الواحدة من المنتج بثمن أرخص من الشراء بالقطعة توجد متاجر خاصة بالبيع بالجملة كما يتوفر هذا الاختيار في كل المحلات العادية كذلك؛ عند شرائك لدستة من منتج معين، سيكون إجمالي السعر أرخص من شراء نفس عدد العبوات بشكل منفرد على أكثر من مرة يمكنك الشراء بالجملة من متاجر السلع المعبئة السوبرماركت ونفس الأمر بالنسبة لمحلات الفاكهة والخضراوات والسلع الغذائية الصحية العضوية يحرص البائعون على توفير سلع مثل الحبوب والبقول والمكرونة غير المعبئة والمكسرات والدقيق والسكر وما شابه، للشراء بالجملة حاول شراء السلع سابقة الذكر من المحلات المدعومة تبعا لوزارة التموين في بلدك، فقد تحصل منها على نفس السلع بنفس جودة العلامات التجارية الكبرى ولكن بسعر مخفض ضع نصب عينيك حقيقة وجود فترة زمنية قصوى يمكنك خلالها استهلاك ما اشتريته من سلع بالجملة، فمهما كان من الممكن تخزينها أو تجميدها، ستجد نفسك أمام حقيقة أن ما اشتريته معرضا لانتهاء صلاحيته بعد عدة شهور استوعب مناسبة تلك الكمية الكبيرة لمعدل استهلاكك أنت وأسرتك ورغبتهم في أكلها أصلا من الأطعمة ودون أن تنسى إدراج فترة صلاحية المنتج ضمن تلك المعادلة الحسابية الصعبة، فلا فائدة من شراء شيء رخيص ولكنه سيلقى على الأرض بلا فائدة عندما يصبح غير صالح للاستخدام لا تترك قسيمة شراء تهرب من تحت يدك بمجرد وجود فرصة للحصول عليها، لكن على الجانب الآخر لا تشتر سوى السلع والمنتجات التي تعرف أنك بحاجة إلى استخدامها لا فائدة من شراء منتج لا تشتريه في العادة مهما كان رخيص الثمن لأنك ستنفق أموالك على ما لا تحتاجه وما لن ترغب في استخدامه، وستضيع أموالك على الأرض بلا فائدة، وستدرك وقتها أنها كانت صفقة خاسرة يمكنك إيجاد قسائم الشراء عبر الإنترنت أو في الجرائد والمجلات، كما يمكنك الاستفادة حديثا من تطبيقات قسائم الشراء على الهواتف الذكية قد تكون مؤهلا للاشتراك في واحدة من برامج دعم الغذاء لمحدودي الدخل في بلدك، وهي الجهات التي توفر الطعام بأسعار مدعومة للمحتاجين تختلف أنظمة دعم التموين والطعام من بلد لآخر، لذانص مائل ستحتاج لإجراء عملية بحث بسيطة لمعرفة إجراءات التسجيل في مثل هذه البرامج قد تجد برامج مخصصة للعاطلين من الأفراد أو السيدات قليلات الدخل أو للأسر كبيرة العدد وما شابه قد لا تتوفر لك في المتاجر التابعة لمثل برامج الدعم تلك كل ما تطمع وتشتهيه من سلع، ولكنك ستجد بها الحد الأدنى من احتياجاتك من الأطعمة الصحية والضروريات اللازمة من الطعام اذهب إلى المكتب المحلي المخصص للتقدم بطلب الحصول على الدعم أو يمكنك التقدم عبر المنصات والمواقع الإلكترونية في حال توفرها تواصلي مع الجهات المسؤولة عن تقديم الدعم للعاطلين وللسيدات محدودات الدخل وما شابه في مدينتك لمعرفة كيفية التقدم للاشتراك في برامج الدعم المماثلة تجد العديد من السلع الغذائية الأرخص سعرا في المتاجر التابعة مباشرة للمزارع المحلية، وإن كنت ستواجه صعوبة في الحصول على احتياجك من السلع نظرا لضغط الطلب وقلة المعروض من منتجات غالبا إنها أطعمة طازجة ولم يضاف إليها تكاليف النقل وأرباح الكثير من الموزعين والبائعين، لذا ستقدر على الحصول عليها بسعر أرخص وجودة أفضل استوعب فقط أنك لن تملك رفاهية تأجيل تناولها كونها لا تظل على حالتها فترات طويلة مقارنة بغيرها من السلع الغذائية المزروعة لتحمل مشقة النقل والفترات الزمنية الطويلة قبل التناول الميزة الإيجابية أنك ستقدر على تناول أطعمة أفضل مذاقا وطزاجة قد تجد بعض المزارع المحلية المدرجة ضمن برامج الدعم الحكومي للطعام والتي توفر للمستحقين إمكانية
